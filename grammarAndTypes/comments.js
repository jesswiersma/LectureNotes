/*
what is a comment?
- code not executed by JavaScript
- When JavaScript runs it will pass over the code as if it were not there. 

What do we use comments for?
- Explain specific lines of code for the developer's future self or other developers who may inherit the code.
- Adds readability to the code by writing in plain english.
- Excluding specific lines of code when running a JavaScript file as a whole.
