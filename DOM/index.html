        DOM = Document Object Model. It allows our javascript to interact with the HTML and CSS of our page. The document object model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it's in the browser window.

        the DOM is an object-oriented representation of a web page which can be modified with a scripting language such as JS. the DOM covers two primary areas:
            1. Making a mode HTML page
                - when the browser loads a webpage it creates a model of the page in memory.
                - the DOM specifies the way in which browsers should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree.
                - the DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree itself is made up of objects
            
            2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
                - the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser

            Accessing/Grabbing an element:
                Common methods for accessing a single element:
                    - getElementById()
                    - querySelector()
                Common methods for accessing multiple elements:
                    - querySelectorAll()
                    - getElementByClassName()
                    - getElementsByTagName()

            Manipulating:
                Common properties and methods for working with html content:
                    - innerHTML 
                    - textContent
                    - createElement()
                Common properties and methods for working with tag attributes:
                    - className / id
                    - setAttribute()
                    - getAttribute()
