//Addition Operator
let x = 1;
let y = 1;

//x = x + 1;
//y += 1
//console.log(x);

//Subtraction Operator
//x = x-1;
//y -=1;
//console.log(x, y);


//Mulitiplication Operator
//x = x * 2;
//y *= 2;
//console.log(x,y)

//Division Operator
//x = x / 2;
//y /= 2;
console.log(x,y);

//Remainder (Modulus) Operator - the answer to this shows as the REMAINDER of the problem
//x = x % 1;
//y %= 1;
//console.log(x,y);

//Exponential Operator
x = x ** 100;
y **= 100;
console.log(x,y);
